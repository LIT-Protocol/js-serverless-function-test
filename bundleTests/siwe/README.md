This example shows how to bundle the SIWE package to create a SIWE signature inside a Lit Action. You can run this example by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```
yarn run siweNodeSide
```

This will bundle toBundle.js into bundled.js, and then run siwe.js which will load bundled.js and run it as a Lit Action.
